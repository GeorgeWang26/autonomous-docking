yaw/alpha > 0 when robot is on the right side of the tag

camera 90 front, 180 left, 270 back

robot turn right with angular.z < 0


to adjust y_offset,
from the tag, facing outward

robot        <---(tag)(face as arrow)

increase offset to make robot move right   ry = ty + 0.08
decrease offset to make robot move left  ry = ty - 0.15



may need to change phase 2 offset for second time
